    <p>
      I used a very old Turtle editor as a starter for Atuin. I'd saved it for later...later was much later.
      The core design - and logo - of Atuin is essentially the same (totally reimplemented under the hood), except the
      earlier app also had a GitHub connector. But I have absolutely no clue who build the original. If anyone knows,
      please let me know so I can give them credit.
